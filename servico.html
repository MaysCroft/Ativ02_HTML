                    Geo is the Rock Element in Genshin Impact and is one out of 7 Elements in the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Geo's only Elemental Reaction is the Crystallize effect, which can interact with all elements except Anemo, 
                    Dendro, and itself. Crystal shards created with Crystallize can provide shields when you pick them up!
                    Geo is the Rock Element in Genshin Impact, with Liyue being the designated Geo Region and Morax, or 
                    Rex Lapis, as the Geo Archon.

                    Having two Geo characters in the party will activate the Geo Buff called Enduring Rock, which increases 
                    shield strength by 15%.
                    Additionally, characters protected by a shield will have their DMG dealt increased by 15% and dealing DMG 
                    to enemies will decrease their Geo RES by 20% for 15s.
